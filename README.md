# Deeplearning.ai Coursework

Many of the labs from deeplearning.ai, but done from "scratch" instead of using their mostly-complete Jupyter notebooks.

In particular, the coffee bean roasting and handwritten digit recognition labs are completed with custom neural network implementations using only NumPy.

The custom neural networks include:
* vectorized implementation of backpropagation
* a very simple adaptive moment algorithm to dynamically adjust learning rate
* parameter regularization
* sigmoid, relu, linear, and softmax layer activations
* mean squared error, binary crossentropy, and sparse categorical crossentropy cost functions
