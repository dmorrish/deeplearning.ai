# Deeplearning.ai Coursework

Many of the labs from deeplearning.ai, but done from "scratch" instead of using their mostly-complete Jupyter notebooks.

In particular, the coffee bean roasting and handwritten digit recognition labs are completed with custom neural network implementations using only NumPy.

The custom neural networks include:
* Vectorized implementation of backpropagation
* A very simple adaptive moment algorithm to dynamically adjust learning rate
* Regularization
* Sigmoid, relu, linear, and softmax layer activations
* Mean Squared Error, Binary Crossentropy, and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy cost functions
